			<h3>Entry 1 - 10/4/21</h3>
				<p>So far I have learned a lot in computer science. I have learned all of the basics of coding. I have learned how to add text to a code and pictures on to it too. These things that I am adding are called divs. I also understand how to add a link onto my divs so that I can access a new page. I am very excited to make new projects and improve my website but I sometimes get frusterated because coding is very particular and so when I mess up it can be difficult to fix the issue. My goals for the next few weeks is to update my website and learn how to use css code well.</p>

			<h3>Entry 2 - 10/13/21</h3>
				<p>Recently, I have made a lot of progress on my website and projects. My styling has become a lot smoother and I am beginning to retain the information that I am learning very quickly. I think that it is really cool that my friends and family can search up my website and see what I have coded. I know that we will begin learning java in the up coming classes so hopefully that will broaden my abilities and allow me to create more projects.</p>
