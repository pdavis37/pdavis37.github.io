			<h3>Entry 1 - 10/4/21</h3>
				<p>So far I have learned a lot in computer science. I have learned all of the basics of coding. I have learned how to add text to a code and pictures on to it too. These things that I am adding are called divs. I also understand how to add a link onto my divs so that I can access a new page. I am very excited to make new projects and improve my website but I sometimes get frusterated because coding is very particular and so when I mess up it can be difficult to fix the issue. My goals for the next few weeks is to update my website and learn how to use css code well.</p>

			<h3>Entry 2 - 10/13/21</h3>
				<p>Recently, I have made a lot of progress on my website and projects. My styling has become a lot smoother and I am beginning to retain the information that I am learning very quickly. I think that it is really cool that my friends and family can search up my website and see what I have coded. I know that we will begin learning java in the up coming classes so hopefully that will broaden my abilities and allow me to create more projects.</p>

			<h3>Entry 3 - 10/21/21</h3>
			<p>This week I learned how to make a CSS animation. This entails making it so that a div that you create can move across the screen. I did this by using the keyframes part of CSS which positions divs in different places throughout different times in your animation. I partnered with one of my class mates to create the animation but the thing that I coded was a background image of Finding Nemo with the shark, Bruce, moving around the screen. I think it is very cool to make animations and I believe my coding skills are getting better every week.</p>

			<h3>Entry 4 - 11/7/21</h3>
			<p>Today, we learned how to use javascript which is a type of code that is different than CSS. Javascript is useful because we are able to create functions in it to do an action continuously. A function that I made was printing different colored circles on a page horizontally. I also made something that would print a soccer player named Akinfenwa on the page. I really enjoyed using javascript because I think it is interesting that we can make a function on our own and run it as many times as we want.</p>

			<h3>Entry 5 - 11/18/21</h3>
			<p>Jackson and I made a code together today. We decided to make a function in java that would print an image of squidward continuously. This function also included the ability to change the image of squidward to an image of Carl from the movie Up, by clicking on any of the squidwards. It felt nice to make this code with Jackson because we did not need to ask for help at all and we figured out how to do it all on our own. I also made major improvements to my website this week by changing the front page and adding my projects and journal entries.</p>

			<h3>Entry 6 - 11/22/21</h3>
			<p>We have to make a gift or project for Thanksgiving so I decided to make one today. I set the background image to be a football field, and played a turkey with a ball on it on the field. I used key frames in order to move the tukey and football from one side of the screen to the other. This was supposed to look like the turkey was running with the ball for a touchdown. Lastly, I added an audio track of a famous commentator saying, "HE COULD GO ALL THE WAY." I enjoyed making this project and I think that my coding is becoming a lot easier and the basics are imprinted in my mind.</p>

			<h3>Entry 7 - 12/1/21</h3>
			<p>Today is the first day of December. Because we are so close to Christmas, I decided to code a project dedicated to that. I first placed a gif of snow in the mountains as the background image and a gif of Santa and his sleigh. Then I moved the Santa into the right spot that I wanted it to be in. Next, I found a picture of the kids from Charlie Brown on Christmas and edited that photo so that it fit with my project. I placed that on the top of the mountain under the sleigh. After that, I found a gif of Homer Simpson building a snowman and put it on the bottom of the hill. Lastly, I created a function that made text appear on the top saying, "Merry Christmas," after you click that general area. I can tell my coding has become so much better because this project that had many different parts to it, was very easy for me.</p>
